## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20.x (Recommended)

## Installation

```sh
pnpm install
```

## Running the Server Locally

```sh
pnpm run dev
```

This will start the development server on http://localhost:8080. The application will automatically reload if you make changes to the source files.

## Build

```sh
pnpm run build
```

## Testing

```sh
pnpm test
```

To run tests in watch mode:

```sh
pnpm test:watch
```

## Mock server

By default we provide demo data from : `https://api-dev-minimal-[version].vercel.app`

To set up your local server:

- **Guide:** [https://docs.minimals.cc/mock-server](https://docs.minimals.cc/mock-server).

- **Resource:** [Download](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/6ojn099upi105tf/AACpmlqrNUacwbBfVdtt2t6va?dl=0).

## Full version

- Create React App ([migrate to CRA](https://docs.minimals.cc/migrate-to-cra/)).
- Next.js
- Vite.js

## Starter version

- To remove unnecessary components. This is a simplified version ([https://starter.minimals.cc/](https://starter.minimals.cc/))
- Good to start a new project. You can copy components from the full version.
- Make sure to install the dependencies exactly as compared to the full version.

**NOTE:**
_When copying folders remember to also copy hidden files like .env. This is important because .env files often contain environment variables that are crucial for the application to run correctly._
